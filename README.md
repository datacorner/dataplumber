# Data Plumber
The purpose of this solution is to build and execute Data Pipelines. Nothing new under the sun of course, however it aims to make this task very simple and by just using the configuration to build those pipelines.  
**So in short ... dataplumber is a Data Pipeline solution by design !**  
The way this solution is built is also totally extensible and enables all developers to extend its capabilities by addin new Data connectors and/or data transformers.  

ðŸš€ Currently this solution provides data access and load from these data sources :  

âœ…  External file (csv)  
âœ…  External Excel Spreadsheet (xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, odf, ods and odt) (in Progress)
âœ…  External XES File (in Progress)
âœ…  ODBC Data Sources (checked with SQL Server) by using an configurable SQL query (Read Only)
âœ…  SAP Read Table via SAP RFC (Read Only / In Progress)

ðŸš€ And provides those transformers
âœ… Nothing !
âœ… Concat to Data sources
