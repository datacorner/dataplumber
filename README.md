# Data Plumber
This solution builds a bridge between two different data sources. It's using a Data Pipeline to make it and respects the 3 steps: Extract, Transform and Load.

ðŸš€ Currently this Data Bridge provides data access and load from these data sources :  

âœ…  External file (csv)  
âœ…  External Excel Spreadsheet (xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, odf, ods and odt)  
âœ…  External XES File  
âœ…  ODBC Data Sources (checked with SQL Server) by using an configurable SQL query  
âœ…  SAP Read Table via SAP RFC
